# Java-Shopping-Cart
This Java mini-project simulates a shopping cart system for an e-commerce platform like Amazon or Myntra. The system allows customers to add multiple products, calculate totals, and apply different types of discounts. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Interfaces.
